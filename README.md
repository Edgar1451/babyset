# babyset
A simple project to be used as homework for CS 4-551.

## Homework DUE in your repo by Thursday BEFORE class at 11am.

1. Fork this project to your repository.
2. Clone **your fork** to your computer.
3. Complete the development tasks listed below then commit and push your changes back up to your GitHub repo.

## Development Tasks: Using Python unittest module.
The babyset project contains a src directory that contains the definition for class named *BabySet* (baby_set.py) and a file containing unittests for the BabySet class methods (test_babyset.py).

### Step 1:
```test_baby_set.py``` requires that you implement the unit tests for ```test_remove``` and ```test_clear```. Out of the box these two unit tests are passing. Read ```baby_set.py``` to understand what you need to test and use the existing unit test implementations as a guide.

**Run the tests.**

### Step 2:
The ```baby_set.py``` contains two errors that will cause your unit tests to fail. Fix those errors so that all tests **pass**.

### Step 3. 
Commit your changes and push to your remote repository.
